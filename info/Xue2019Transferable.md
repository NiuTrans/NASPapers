## Abstract
Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is an active area on the design of deep neural networks for specific tasks and datasets. Given the complexity of discovering new network designs, methods for speeding up the search procedure are becoming important. This paper presents a so-called transferable AutoML approach that Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is an active area on the design of deep neural networks for specific tasks and datasets. Given the complexity of discovering new network designs, methods for speeding up the search procedure are becoming important. This paper presents a so-called transferable AutoML approach that leverages previously trained models to speed up the search process for new tasks and datasets. Our approach involves a novel meta-feature extraction technique based on the performance of benchmark models, and a dynamic dataset clustering algorithm based on Markov process and statistical hypothesis test. As such multiple models can share a common structure while with different learned parameters. The transferable AutoML can either be applied to search from scratch, search from predesigned models, or transfer from basic cells according to the difficulties of the given datasets. The experimental results on image classification show notable speedup in overall search time for multiple datasets with negligible loss in accuracy.
