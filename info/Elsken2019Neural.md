## Abstract
Deep Learning has enabled remarkable progress over the last years on a variety of tasks,
such as image recognition, speech recognition, and machine translation. One crucial aspect
for this progress are novel neural architectures. Currently employed architectures have
mostly been developed manually by human experts, which is a time-consuming and error-
prone process. Because of this, there is growing interest in automated neural architecture
search methods. We provide an overview of existing work in this field of research and cate-
gorize them according to three dimensions: search space, search strategy, and performance
estimation strategy.
